Proposed Fuzix Standard Floppy Disk Formats

8" Drives

SD:		26 sectors per track, 128 bytes per sector soft skew
		of 6. IBM 3740 format, standard CP/M format. May be hard
		sectored. Usually 77 tracks. Defacto world wide standard
		for 8" single density.
DD:		16 sectors per track, 512 bytes per sector,  skewed at format
		time. (Cromemco and others).

5.25" Drives: 	May be 35, 40, 77 or 80 track. Doublestep may be needed.

SD:		18 sectors per track, 128 bytes per sector, skewed at format
		time or do we do  9 / 256 ?.

DD:		10 sectors per track, 512 bytes per sector, skewed at format
		time. Must also support 9 sectors/track (IBM PC format).

HD:		15 sectors per track, 512 bytes per sector, skewed at format
		time. (IBM PC format).

3.5" Drives:

SD:		--

DD:		As 5.25"

HD:		18 sectors per track, 512 bytes per sector, skewed at format
		time. (IBM PC format)

EHD:		18 sectors per track, 512 bytes per sector, skewed at format
		time. (IBM PC format)

3" Drives:	May be 40 or 80 track, single or double sided

DD:		9 sectors per track, 512 bytes/sector, skewed at format time.
		(Amstrad format).

		Flippable media can either me treated as one file system (only
		readable properly on a double sided drive), or two

		Double step may be needed

General Rules:

Systems should support physical media formats used by other common OS on their
platform, even if not auto-detected. Floppy media should not be partitioned.
Logical sector order is sector/side/track. In other words blocks are ordered on
track 0 side 0, then track 0 side 1, then track 1 side 0 and so forth.

Platforms that mix 40 and 80 track media should support double step if possible.

Some platforms have their own way of doing things so will need a different
private formatting default. They should if possible also support something
standard. This affects Apple and Commodore mostly.
