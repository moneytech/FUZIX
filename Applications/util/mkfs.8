MKFS(8)
## NAME
*mkfs* \[-f\] device isize fsize

## DESCRIPTION
The *mkfs* tool initializes a new file system on a device.

The isize field specifies the number of inode blocks on the file system.
Each inode block holds 8 inodes. This determines the number of individual
files and directories that may be present on the disk.

The fsize field gives the size of the media in 512 byte blocks - up to 65535
blocks for 32MB media.

The default behaviour is to zero the entire file system and then write the
new metadata to the device. If the -f flag is passed then the data areas are
not cleared, bad data blocks may not be found and old data may persist in
blocks not allocated to files.

## BUGS
None know

## STANDARDS
Whilst most Fuzix-like systems have a mkfs command the syntax, functionality
and file system format varies extensively.
