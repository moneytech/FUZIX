CHMEM(8)
## NAME
*chmem* - change memory allocation for a binary
## SYNOPSIS
*chmem* \[size\] path

## DESCRIPTION
*Chmem* shows and updates the header field in a Fuzix binary that indicates
the largest amount of dynamic memory and stack required. The zero value means
unlimited. The application is not guaranteed to get that much memory, it is
instead a promise by the application not to use any more.

When *size* is specified the binary is updated for that size in bytes. When
no size is specified the current setting is displayed.

## SEE ALSO ##
*size*(1)

## BUGS ##
It would be far more useful to be able to specify the amount of stack
required.
Only certain memory manager support this field, others will always allocate
as it was zero. This makes testing chmem settings difficult.

## FUTURE ##
This interface will be obsoleted in favour of a stack size setting in some future
release.

## STANDARDS ##
Fuzix specific. Minix has a similar chmem feature.
