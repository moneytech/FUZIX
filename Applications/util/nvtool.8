SETBOOT(8)
## NAME
*nvtool* - manipulate non-volatile RAM settings
## SYNOPSIS
*nvtool*  \[reg val\]
## DESCRIPTION
The *nvtool* command displays or sets values in non-volatile memory (nvram). The
amount of nvram available will depend upon the platform. In some platforms
the nvram is used by the firmware so this command should be used with great
care.
If the command is run without arguments it will dump the nvram data for the
platform. If run with an address and value it will update that byte of the
nvram.
## STANDARDS
