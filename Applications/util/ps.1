PS(1)
## NAME
*ps* - report current processes
## SYNOPSIS
*ps* \[options\]
## DESCRIPTION
The *ps* command displays information about processes that are executing on
the system at the time the command is run. The range of processes that are
reported is controllable by the options as is the output formatting.
## OPTIONS
:*-A*
  Identical to *-e*
:*-a*
  Show all the processes except those not associated with a terminal
:*-e*
  Select all processes.
:*-f*
  Select full format listing style.
:*-l*
  Select long format listing style.
:*-N*
  Invert the process selection and show every process not matching the
  matching rules.
:*-p \[pidlist\]*
  Select only processes whose process id matches those given in the list
:*-r*
  Select only processes that are currently in running or ready state, not
  anything sleeping.
:*-t \[ttylist\]*
  Matches only those processes whose terminal is one of those in the list.
  Terminals may be described in full '/dev/tty04', by ttyname 'tty04' or by
  number '04'.
:*-U \[uidlist\]*
  Matches only those processes whose real uid is in the uid list provided.
:*-u \[uidlist\]*
  As *-U*. Note that this is a deviation from the standard.
## EXIT STATUS
*ps* returns an exit status 0 on success, or 1 if an error occurs.
## SEE ALSO
## STANDARDS
The *ps* command is defined in POSIX 1003.1. Certain additional behaviours
are defined in XSI (X/Open System Interfaces Extension).

Fuzix deviates from the standard as it does not support the -G option for
group matching, and -u matches the real not the effective uid. The -o option
is not supported. Most XSI extensions are not implemented, although the
output format is close to XSI specification.

## BUGS
XSI says that command data provided by the kernel not obtained via ptrace or
similar should be in square brackets. Fuzix only uses the kernel provided
command data but does not bracket it.
