Implement

- Actually look up the address properly
- Get the splash screen off disk instead?
- A correct flash screen
- Make it a lot faster
- Find and scan the modes for suitable graphics drivers (really we need
  to do loadable drivers)
- Build scaling table dynamically from reported size

Obvious targets

- mono directly mapped (Dragon32 etc)
- TRS80 I/O port graphics
- VDP (ewww....)
- Indirect ioctl interfaced (pixels easy, rects easy, lines fast will be
  a PITA.. maybe we do need line as an ioctl primitive ?)
