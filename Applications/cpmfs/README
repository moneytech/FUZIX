Description:

Cpm lets UNIX users read and write standard cp/m 8" floppy disks and
provides a cp/m like user interface for manipulating cp/m files.


Somewhat cleaned up and ANSIfied by Alan Cox for Fuzix

This is WIP for 16bit int, a lot of type clean up is needed to begin with so
use with care and don't expect it to work on larger media types.
