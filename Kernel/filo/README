FILO

Initial draft of a loader that is designed to be a portable Z80 loading tool
that can load Fuzix images out of a Fuzix file system.

Commands

*xxx		anything beginning * is handed to the platform specific code
		so may be relevant or not.

[A-P]:		capital required - select drive to load from
		(will also allow A0-P3 once we do partitions)

any other string is taken as a filename to search for in / of the current
volume and boot as a kernel image.
