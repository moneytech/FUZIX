This is a prototype Fuzix for the RC2014 with only the pageable ROM. Fuzix
occupies the ROM and loads its data and high space from disk on boot.

This is btw not a good way to run Fuzix, it's more for the challenge!

Memory map

Kernel mode

0000-7FFF	Kernel (and bootstrap)
8000-BFFF	Discardables / Userspace
C000-FFFF	Kernel

User mode (one process in memory at a time, swap mandatory)

0000-BFFF	User space
C000-FFFF	Kernel


Things that don't work

  * Flow control isn't yet enabled for the serial port.

Stuff To Do

  * It could be made a chunk smaller if we dumped the nice fancy IDE support
    for simple block IDE without full partitions etc.

  * Set up SIO with some kind of fast IRQ path or we'll drop a lot of bytes
    (perhaps in IRQ only do rtc check if fifo empty or something ?)
