First wild guesses at TBBlue support

8K paging also needs debug

Currently goal is

load kernel into pages 16-23
switch 16-22 into memory
jump to kernel 0x0100
switch 23 into memory
set up and go

TODO:
DONE	program_vectors
DONE	review where font and video code needs to land
	Use nextreg
	memory sizing
DONEish	set up page map properly

	See if we can make it boot


Bigger issues
- We actually want a banked kernel so that we can put networking in its
  own bank and maybe external buffers. We have tons of RAM and fast DMA.
- Need to look at optimal inter bank copies for user copying and buffers.
