This is an emulated platform driver for the V85 virtual 8085. The main goal is
to see what can be done to improve 8085 over 8080. It also provides a way to test
the IDE and modern block layer code with ackcc.

TODO

Review fast bank copiers to see what a slower but saner one might look like
so we can keep interrupts on

Perhaps repeats of:

		lhlx
		mov a,b
		out a
		shlx
		mov a,c
		out a
		inx
		inx

		pop b
		dex b
		jnk loop ...
