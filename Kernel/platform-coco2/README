Memory Map

0400-7FFF	Code/Data for kernel (take care to keep this below 8000 and
		shuffle stuff if needed to make it fit)
8000-F1FF	User space (28.5K)
F200-FBFF	More kernel bits
FD00-FEFF	udata
FF00-FFFF	I/O etc


Emulating in XRoar
==================

Needs the IDE patches

TODO
====

Loader code
Set the display up correctly
Support for a real time clock and clock locking
Review irq disabling. We shouldn't need much of this at all as we don't have
floppy hell to contend with, but the switchin/switchout logic needs to be
reviewed for interrupt safety and the IRQs re-enabled during swap in and
out. We should also be totally clean now on FIR blocking, so audio might
actually be doable!

MPI switching

See platform-coco2cart for the actual resulting cartridge based implementation
